    "## Catalog Data Processing Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code implements a series of classes for fetching and processing catalog data from a given API, focusing on CNIL (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés) data in this example. Below are detailed explanations of each part of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### GetSourceCatalog Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This class provides basic functionalities for fetching and processing catalog data from an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "- `__init__(self, url, headers)`: Initializes the GetSourceCatalog object with the API URL and necessary headers for requests.\n",
    "- `fetch_data_from_api(self)`: Fetches data from the API and returns it as a list.\n",
    "- `response_to_dataframe(self, data, table_name, download_url, table_id=None, file_format=None, last_update=None, dataset_id=None, dataset_name=None, frequency=None, accessURL=None)`: Processes API response data into a DataFrame, with parameters to specify keys for different pieces of information.\n",
    "- `save_to_csv(self, filename)`: Saves catalog data to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CustomCatalog Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This class inherits from GoogleConnector and extends its functionalities to work with custom catalogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "- `__init__(self, credentials_path, project_id=None, dataset_name=None)`: Initializes the CustomCatalog object with the credentials path, project ID, and dataset name.\n",
    "- `create_catalog_gcs(self, zip_file)`: Creates a catalog from a zip file containing data, extracting information such as table name, update date, and file format.\n",
    "- `bq_catalog_all_datasets(self)`: Gets BigQuery modification dates for all tables in all datasets of the project.\n",
    "- `bq_raw_catalog(self)`: Gets BigQuery modification dates for all tables in a specific dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GetCnilCatalog Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This class inherits from GetSourceCatalog and adds specific functionalities for working with CNIL catalog data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods:\n",
    "- `__init__(self, url, headers, url_additional_info)`: Initializes the GetCnilCatalog object with the CNIL API URL, headers, and the URL of a CSV file containing additional information.\n",
    "- `load_additional_info(self)`: Loads additional information from the CSV file.\n",
    "- `identify_datasets_info(self)`: Identifies dataset information and adds it to the catalog DataFrame.\n",
    "- `merge_additional_info(self)`: Merges additional information into the catalog DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The code demonstrates how to use the GetCnilCatalog class to fetch, process, and save CNIL catalog data. Here's a summary of the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Creating an instance of GetCnilCatalog with the CNIL API URL, headers, and the URL of the CSV file containing additional information.\n",
    "2. Fetching data from the API.\n",
    "3. Processing the data into a DataFrame using the response_to_dataframe method.\n",
    "4. Loading additional information from the CSV file.\n",
    "5. Identifying dataset information in the DataFrame.\n",
    "6. Merging additional information into the DataFrame.\n",
    "7. Saving the data to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line of code demonstrates how to execute these steps and save the catalog data to a CSV file named \"source_cnil_catalog.csv\".\n"
